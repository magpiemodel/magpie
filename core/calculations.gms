****************************PREPROCESSING START*********************************
* In this section everything is calculated that is not influenced by the
* optimization process. Hence these lines CAN INFLUENCE the optimization process
* but CANNOT BE INFLUENCED by it.

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" start

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" preloop

*****************************PREPROCESSING END**********************************


* create dummy file (this is necessary to be able to use put_utility and it has
* to be done here because a file declaration cannot be inside a loop
file dummy; dummy.pw=2000; put dummy;


************************OPTIMIZATION PROCESS START******************************
* This section contains only sourcecode that is directly connected to the
* optimization process. That means that everything on the following lines
* INFLUENCES and IS INFLUENCED by the optimization process (except the
* redefinition on preprocessed data).
* Hence one can describe this section together with the constraints section
* as "model-core".

* clear ct set
ct(t) = no;

***************************TIMESTEP LOOP START**********************************
loop (t,

* set ct to current time period
      ct(t) = yes;

      display "Year";
      display ct;

*************************SOLVE STATEMENT START**********************************

* #### additional phases ###
* set additional phases which should be detected by
* update_module_embeddings. Most phases will be detected automatically,
* but batincludes used within a module are not detected and therefore
* have to be set manually! (Syntax: "* !add_phase!: <phase>")
* !add_phase!: nl_fix
* !add_phase!: nl_release
* !add_phase!: nl_relax
