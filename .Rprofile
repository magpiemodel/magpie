# This profile can be used to link the model to a specified library snapshot
# (e.g. if your model version is from an older date and does not work with the
# newest libraries anymore) 
# By default it is not active. Just uncomment the following lines and set the
# snapshot path to a path of your choice
# Please make also sure that in your config file this .Rprofile file is copied
# to the model output folder. Otherwise, the run itself will again use the
# default library set!
