# * This realisation allows to define a target value and year for the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII)
# * that is applied in each biome type of each biogeographic realm or at the global level.
# * The lower bound increases in each biome linearly from the BII level in the start year (s44_start_year) to the value defined in `s44_bii_lower_bound` in the target year (s44_target_year).
# * The BII has been proposed as a control variable for changes in ecosystem functioning at the global scale
# * and has shown to capture increasing levels of ecosystem degradation. Steffen et al. (2015, 10.1126/science.1259855) have proposed
# * a premliminary boundary of 0.9 at the biome level (safe space) but with an uncertainty range of 0.9-0.3,
# * in which ecosystem degradation may undermine stable ecosystem functioning and the supply of nature's
# * contributions to people (NCP). With BII values below 0.3, the area's biodiversity has been depleted,
# * causing high risk of ecosystem collapse. Estimates for the global BII range between 0.7975 in 1970 and 0.7754
# * in 2000. https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/biodiversity-indicators/biodiversity-intactness-index-data

# *     In the baseeff_add scenarios, the baseline NUE starts from historical

# *     the efficiency increases until 2020,2050 and 2100, always relative to
# *     2010. The max efficiency is the maximum base efficiency in 2050
# *     and 2100. "baseeff_add3_add15_add25_max65" means that China with a
# *     current NUE of 41 increases to 44% by 2010, 56% by 2050 and 65% by 2100,
# *     while the USA, with a current NUE of 71% has a falling base NUE to 65%
# *     by 2050 and 2100. These base NUEs can however be improved by the MACCs,

# *     Scenarios with a globaly uniform target NUE. This target NUE is achieved
# *     by the combination of full MACCs and baseline NUE. First number is the
# *     again additive efficiency increase until 2020, second number is
# *     max NUE in 2050, third in 2100. Example: maxeff_add3_glo75_glo85
# *     means efficiency increases a regional specific 3 percentag point
# *     improvement until 2020, and then it achieves a globally uniform 75%
# *     efficiency in y2050; the baseline NUE value is therefore about 63%,
# *     while the MACCs can increase this to 75%. In 2100, the baseline NUE
# *     increases to 74%, which can achieve 85% if combined with
# *     the MACCs.

# *     These two scenarios reach the max NUE of Zhang et al under application
