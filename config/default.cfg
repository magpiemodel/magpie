# *     the efficiency increases until 2020,2050 and 2100, always relative to
# *     2010. The max efficiency is the maximum base efficiency in 2050
# *     and 2100. "baseeff_add3_add15_add25_max65" means that China with a
# *     current NUE of 41 increases to 44% by 2010, 56% by 2050 and 65% by 2100,
# *     while the USA, with a current NUE of 71% has a falling base NUE to 65%

# *     max NUE in 2050, third in 2100. Example: maxeff_add3_glo75_glo85
# *     means efficiency increases a regional specific 3 percentag point
# *     improvement until 2020, and then it achieves a globally uniform 75%
# *     efficiency in y2050; the baseline NUE value is therefore about 63%,
# *     while the MACCs can increase this to 75%. In 2100, the baseline NUE
# *     increases to 74%, which can achieve 85% if combined with
# *     the MACCs.
