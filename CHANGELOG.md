- **scripts** The disaggregation_LUH2.R was extended to include the changes used to generate ISIMIP3b maps for LUH harmonization. The largest changes are: 1) The convertLUH function now breaks the grid level magpie objects by groups of years, then creates the raster for the groups and aggregates them to create the final map at a quarter of a degree resolution (this speeds up the process). 2) The mapping between LUH and MAgPIE is now defined by country and magpie-LUH types (not 1 to 1 anymore). 3) The split of MAgPIE's pasture land type between pasture and rangeland changed. Rangeland is assumed to stay constant after 2015, and changes in MAgPIE's pasture are due to managed pasture. 4) IFs were added so if a certain map already exists in the output folder, it will not generate it once again. 5) Flooded land now corresponds to a share of rice cropland, based on historical values. 6) To speed calculations, yields are read at the cell level, the crops are aggregated based on the new MAgPIE-LUH mapping, and then disaggregated to grid level.

- **35_natveg** Calculation of land protection policies revised and moved from presolve.gms to preloop.gms
- **38_factor_costs** Realization `sticky_feb18` extended to differentiate capital requirements between regions and their specific development status (GDP) in each time step of the magpie run. The changes in the `sticky` realization also include an additional switch so it can be operated as `dynamic` (change of each region capital share at each time step) or `free` (capital shares equal to zero and equivalent to the `fixed_per_ton_mar18` realization). Bugfix in the yearly update of the variable input requirements. Addition of the time dimension and clean up of names of parameters used in the realization. Removal of the management factor (this factor was not being used, it was being cancelled out in previous calculations). Correction of the costs, they are given in 05USDppp.

- **58_peatland** Peatland area is initialized in 1995 based on levels for the year 2015, and hold fixed depending on `s58_fix_peatland`. This provides a better proxy for peatland area and associated GHG emissions for the historic period, which where assumed zero in previous versions.
- **80_optimization** **nlp_par** parallelizes now on superregional level `h` instead of regional level `i` as before.
- **script** Added forestry run script which used LPJmL addon
- **script** New standard for cluster to region mapping (rds-files) is used in all scripts. If old spam files are provided by input data, rds-mapping file is created.

- **14_yield** Added new realization `managementcalib_aug19` that is able to calibrate yield data coming from uncalibrated crop models (e.g. LPJmL yields for unlimited N supply). The yield calibration is either a purely multipicative factor or is limited to additive change in case of a underestimated FAO yield by the initial crop model yields (based on the switch `s14_limit_calib`). For pastures spillover of crop yield increases due to technological change from the previous time step are allowed and can be scaled using `s14_yld_past_switch`.
- **20_processing** Added new almost identical realization that excludes a calibration of the oil crop demand for oils (Note: old realization can be removed, when old yield realizations are deleted).
- **30_crop** Added new realization `endo_apr21`. The realisation includes new input data for available cropland and a new switch `c30_marginal_land`, which provides different options for including marginal land as cropland. Furthermore, a given share of the available cropland can be set aside for the provisioning of natures contribution to people and to promote biodiversity. The new switches `s30_set_aside_shr` and `c30_set_aside_target` are included to specify the share that should be set aside and the target year.

- **58_peatland** Added option for one-time and recurring costs of peatland degradation (USD05MER per ha)
- **calibration run** has two new features: 1. Upper bound to cropland factor can be added (`crop_calib_max`). 2. Best calibration factor (factor with the lowest divergence) can be picked individually for each regions based on all calibration factors calculated during the calibration run iteration (`best_calib`).
- **disaggregation** Added new disaggregation script that is in line with new crop realisation and can account for cropland availabilty on grid level during disaggregation (see `interpolateAvlCroplandWeighted()` in package `luscale` for further details).
- **sets** added superregional layer `h` as additional spatial layer and moved constraints in **13_tc** and **21_trade** partly to the superregional level.

- A new scenario (nocc_hist) was added to the cc/nocc switch. In this scenario, parameters affected by the cc/nocc switch in **14_yields**,**42_water_demand**,**43_water_availability**,**52_carbon**,**59_som** keep their historical/variable values up to the year defined by sm_fix_cc. Afterwards, sm_fix_cc values are kept constant for the overall run horizon.

 - **12_interest_rate** merged the two realizations (glo_jan16 and reg_feb18) into one (select_apr20) with same functionality and add on of option to choose different interest rate scenarios for different regions selected via country switch select_countries12
 - **scripts** streamlined and improved performance of NPI/NDC preprocessing

## [4.2.0] - 2020-04-15

This release version is focussed on consistency between the MAgPIE setup and the [REMIND model] and result of a validation exercise of the coupled (REMIND 2.1)-(MAgPIE 4.2) system.

### added
 - **config** Added new socioeconomic scenario (SDP) to scenario_config.csv (which include all switches to define among others the SSP scenarios). For the parametrization of the new SDP (Sustainable Development Pathway) scenario, the list of scenario switches was extended to account for a broad range of sustainability dimensions.
 - **10_land** added new land realization landmatrix_dec18 to directly track land transition between land use types
 - **15_food** stronger ruminant fade out in India
 - **15_food** Added exogenous food substitution scenarios that can be selected via settings in the config-file, defining speed of convergence, scenario targets and transition periods (applied after the food demand model is executed). Among these scenarios are the substitution of livestock products with plant-based food commodities and the substitution of beef or fish with poultry. The food substitution scenarios are based on the model-native, regression-based calculation of food intake and demand.
 - **15_food** Added exogenous EAT Lancet diet scenarios: It is now possible to define in the config-file exogenous diet scenarios that replace the regression-based calculation of food intake and demand. Possible settings are the target for total calorie intake (e.g. according to a healthy BMI) and variants of the EAT Lancet diet (e.g. in addition to the flexitarian a vegetarian or vegan variant).
 - **15_food** Added exogenous food waste scenarios which can be defined via settings in the config-file, including scenario targets for the ratio between food demand and intake and the year in which full transition to the target should be achieved.
 - **30_crop** added crop specific land use initialization pattern (used as interface for other modules)
 - **50_nr_soil_budget and 55_awms** Additional inputs for the GoodPractice Scenario.
 - **52_carbon** Added new forest growth curve parameters based on Braakhekke et al. 2019. Growth curves are now differentiated between natural vegetation (default) and plantations.
 - **59_som** added new realization static_jan19 (new default) including all soil carbon related calculations. Before all carbon pools were updated in the specific land use type modules. This still holds true for the above ground pools (vegetation and litter carbon)
 - **.gitattributes** file added to set line ending handling to auto for all text files
 - **scaling** added scaling.gms files for several modules to improve optimization (based on gdx::calc_scaling)
 - **scripts** added output scripts for global soil carbon maps (SoilMaps.R).

### changed
 - **config** new default ghg emission pricing policy "redd+_nosoil" in c56_emis_policy. Includes all pools included in the previous default "SSP_nosoil", and in addition "forestry".
 - **13_tau** lower bound for vm_tau for historical time steps
 - **50_nr_soil_budget** atmospheric deposition is now estimated on the cluster-level instead of the region level to improve spatial patterns.
 - **56_ghg_policy** updated scenarios in f56_emis_policy: none, all natural (called 'ssp') and all land use change emissions (pure co2) being included in greenhouse gas pricing. ssp and all also featuring additional scenarios excluding soil carbon pricing (marked with '_nosoil' postscript).
 - **56_ghg_policy** Several changes regarding afforestation: use of detailed formula for incentive calculation instead of simplified Hotelling formula, 50 year planning horizon (instead of 80 years), phase-in of GHG prices deactivated by default (now done in REMIND), CO2 price reduction factor deactivated by default, introduced buffer reduction factor of 20% for afforestation.
 - **59_som** updated cellpool_aug16 realization to use new interfaces from land module on land use type specific land expansion and reduction as well as crop type specific land initialization pattern. Additionally added irrigation as stock change factor sub-type. N fertilizer from soil organic matter decomposition is truncated after threshold to avoid unrealistically high fertilization rates.
 - **80_optimization** write extended run information in list file in the case that the final solution is infeasible
 - **modules** modular structure updated from version 1 to version 2
 - **line endings** changed to unix-style for all text files

### fixed
 - **modules** Fixing of all parameters to SSP2 values until 2020 (switch sm_fix_SSP2) for having identical outcomes in all scenarios (SDP, SSP1-5) until 2020.
 - **21_trade** Bugfix kall instead of k in exo realization; Bufix begr/betr trade in default realization; Bugfix sets in free realization
 - **32_forestry** NPI/NDC afforestation targets are now counted towards the global afforestation limit, which can be set for specific scenarios via the switch *s32maxaff_area* and constrains the potential for carbon-price induced endogenous afforestation.
 - **56_ghg_policy** bugfix full soil carbon loss in default setting, renamed it from ssp to ssp_nosoil, indicating, that soil carbon losses are not priced.
 - **56_ghg_policy** bugfix afforestation: vmbtm_cell was a free variable for some sources and pollutants, which could result in GHG cost neutral shifting of age classes to ac0 (e.g. from ac55 to ac0).
 - **80_optimization** added fallback routine for CONOPT4 failure (fatal system error)


## [4.1.1] - 2020-03-09

This version provides the model version used for the publication starved, stuffed and wasteful. It provides a few technical updates compared to the 4.1 release, which include

### changed
- **core** allow for flexible calibration period of the model, which allows for uncalibrated runs of the past for validation purposes
- **15_food** Parameters for bodyheight regressions were included explicitly as input parameters
- **config** updated input data of the drivers and food demand regressions

### fixed
- **15_food** Precision of iteration convergence criterium for magpie-demandmodel-iteration is calculated more precisely, avoiding unnecessary iterations.


## [4.1.0] - 2019-05-02

 - **56_ghg_policy** apply reduction factor on CO2 price to account for potential negative side effects; lowers the economic incentive for CO2 emission reduction (avoided deforestation) and afforestation
 - **56_ghg_policy** non-linar phase-in of GHG prices over 20 year period
 - **56_ghg_policy** multiply GHG prices with development state to account for institutional requirements needed for implementing a GHG pricing scheme

 - **interpolation scripts** changed output files to seven magpie land use types, added additional cropsplit script for more detailed cropland output
 - **15_food** clean-up and cosmetic changes (correction of comments, parameter names, structure of code); update BMI share calculations with the values of the last consistent MAgPIE/food-demand-model iteration

### fixed
 - **42_water_demand** bugfix environmental flow policy harmonization for historic period
 - **57_maccs** correction of cost calculation; Conversion from USD per ton C to USD per ton N and USD per ton CH4 was missing.
 - **71_diagg_lvst** adjusted monogastric disaggregation for more flexiblity to avoid infeasibilities with EFPs (see 42_water_demand)
 - **15_food** correction regarding the convergence measure of the iterative execution of the food demand model and MAgPIE; correction accounting for unusual time step length in body height calculations; body height regression parameters updated
