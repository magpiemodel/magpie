* This is a standalone skeleton which should be used as template
* if only parts of the model should be run. It contains the basic,
* structural components of the model.
* To use it, please copy this file, give it an explaining name and
* save it in the "models" folder. After that you can modify it based
* on the given requirements. You can add own code, but also delete
* code (e.g. the model statement or the provided loops) if these parts
* are irrelevant for your analysis.

****************************PREPROCESSING START*********************************
* In this section everything is calculated that is not influenced by the
* optimization process. Hence these lines CAN INFLUENCE the optimization process
* but CANNOT BE INFLUENCED by it.

$batinclude "./modules/include.gms" preloop

*p_example(exampleset) = 1;

* create dummy file (this is necessary to be able to use put_utility and it has
* to be done here because a file declaration cannot be inside a loop
file dummy; dummy.pw=2000; put dummy;

************************OPTIMIZATION PROCESS START******************************
* This section contains only sourcecode that is directly connected to the
* optimization process. That means that everything on the following lines
* INFLUENCES and IS INFLUENCED by the optimization process (except the
* redefinition on preprocessed data).
* Hence one can describe this section together with the constraints section
* as "model-core".

*************************SOLVE STATEMENT START**********************************

* set additional phases which should be detected by
* update_module_embeddings. Most phases will be detected automatically,
* but batincludes used within a module are not detected and therefore
* have to be set manually! (Syntax: "* !add_phase!: <phase>")
