title: MAgPIE - An Open Source land-use modeling framework
abstract: The *Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment* (MAgPIE)
  is a modular open source framework for modeling global land-systems, which is
  coupled to the grid-based dynamic vegetation model LPJmL, with a spatial resolution
  of 0.5degx0.5deg. It takes regional economic conditions such as demand for agricultural
  commodities, technological development and production costs as well as spatially
  explicit data on potential crop yields, land and water constraints (from LPJmL) into
  account. Based on these, the model derives specific land use patterns, yields and
  total costs of agricultural production for each grid cell. The objective function of
  the land use model is to minimize total cost of production for a given amount of
  regional food and bioenergy demand. Regional food energy demand is defined for an
  exogenously given population in 10 food energy categories, based on regional diets.
  Future trends in food demand are derived from a cross-country regression analysis,
  based on future scenarios on GDP and population growth.
