*' Transportation costs for each cell are calculated as the product of

*' and the transport costs.

*' As cellular distance information `f40_distance(j2)`, the European Commission
*' Joint Research Centre (EC JRC)â€™s 30 arc-second resolution map on travel time
*' for any location on the earth surface to the nearest large city is used
*' (figure below - @nelson_transport_2008). The data set is based on multiple
*' indicators (biophysical, administrative and transport mode) which determine the
*' friction surface that in turn determines the time needed to transport goods
*' across grid cells. The cumulated time needed to reach an urban center
*' of minimal 50000 inhabitants stands as static proxy for accessibility of a
*' grid cell.

*' Relative transport costs `f40_transport_costs(k)` are calibrated using total
*' agricultural transport costs taken from the GTAP 7 database (see @narayanan_gtap7_2008
*' for a general description of the GTAP model structure). GTAP agricultural
*' transport costs represent transport costs from one sector to another sector
*' (e.g. from a farm to the mill). Based on GTAP we calculate sector to sector
*' transport costs for agricultural inputs and outputs. In MAgPIE we want to
*' represent market to market transport costs. Since markets are the links between
*' sectors, we assume that the sum of 50% of the agricultural input transport costs
*' and 50% of the output transport costs represent the agricultural transport costs
*' for a commodity.

*' Relative transport costs `f40_transport_costs(k)` are calculated by dividing
*' total agricultural transport costs from GTAP 7 by the product of an initial
*' (1995 as default) cellular MAgPIE production pattern and cellular travel time.
*' By doing so we ensure that relative transport costs, multiplied with the
*' initial MAgPIE production allocation and given travel times match the absolute
*' transport costs as reported by GTAP 7.
*'
*' Total agricultural transport costs from GTAP 7 are based on total agricultural
*' production in 2004. For consistency, we scale the GTAP data with the ratio of
*' FAO production data for 2004 and 1995. Subsequently, MAgPIE is run several
*' times in yield calibration mode until regional MAgPIE production is consistent
*' with FAO production for the initial time step. Based on this first calibration
*' run, total MAgPIE transportation costs are summed up and compared with GTAP data
*' (see Figure 3). In case of low agreement, the calculation of relative transportation
*' costs is repeated based on the calibrated MAgPIE production pattern and a second
*' round of MAgPIE yield calibration is started. This process is repeated until MAgPIE
*' total transport costs are in good agreement with GTAP total transport costs.
