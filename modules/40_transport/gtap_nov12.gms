*' @description In this realization transportation costs
*' are calculated based on the assumption that transport
*' costs are proportional to the mass which has to be
*' transported and the time which is required for the transport.
*'

*' production sites and markets is static over time,
*' meaning that infrastructure is assumed to be static
*' over time.
