*' @title Transport
*'
*' @description The [40_transport] module simulates the intraregional 
*' transportation of agricultural products between producer site 
*' and the next city centre (market). It covers the transport of 
*' inputs such as fertilizers to the production site as well as 
*' the transport of products to the market. Calculations are based 
*' on cellular and global parameters and returns the corresponding 
*' cellular transport costs which are then used by the [11_costs] module.
