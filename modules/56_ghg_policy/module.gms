*' @title Greenhouse gas policy
*'
*' @description The module 56_ghg_policy connects emissions to costs which then enter 
*' the objective function of MAgPIE. Connecting emissions with costs in a cost 
*' minimization model like MAgPIE creates an incentive to reduce emissions. 
*' This can be interpreted as an internalization of the external costs by pollution, 
*' e.g. by policies that deincentivize polluting activity. 
*' Technically, every ton of emission is multiplied with an emission price to 
*' determine emission costs. Emission sources can be excluded from pricing by switches 
*' defined in config/default.cfg.
*'
*' Please note that emissions that occur only once (e.g. CO2 emissions from deforestation) 
*' are handled differently than emissions that occur in every timestep 
*' (e.g. CH4 and N2O emissions from agricultural production).
