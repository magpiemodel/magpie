*' @title Optimization
*'
*' @description This module takes care of the model optimization of
*' the main model, allowing for switching between optimization procedures.
*' It has been introduced to play with different ways to affect the runtime
*' performance of the model via more optimized model solution strategies.
*' The interfaces to the rest of the model are quite limited as it only requires
*' the variables to be optimized `vm_cost_glo` (total costs) and `vm_landdiff`
*' (gross land use changes compared to last time step) as direct input.
*' The latter was introduced to select out of a range of cost optimal patterns
*' that one which is closest to the pattern of the previous time step. While
*' CONOPT returns this solution by default, CPLEX does not.
