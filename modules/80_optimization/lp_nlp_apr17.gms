*' @description In this realization, instead of directly starting the nonlinear
*' optimization, a linear version of the model is solved beforehand. In order to
*' linearize the model all nonlinear terms are fixed to best guesses for the
*' respective values. The linear solution serves as an improved starting point
*' for the nonlinear optimization.
*'

*' @limitations This realization requires that all module realizations with
*' nonlinear terms provide a `nl_fix.gms` and `nl_release.gms` which fix and
*' release all nonlinear terms in the module. If this is missing and there are
*' still active, nonlinear terms in the linear solve attempt the model run will
*' be cancelled by an error.
