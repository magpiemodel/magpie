*' @description This module represents agricutlural trade among world regions.
*' It ensures that the regional demand is met by domestic production and imports from other regions.
*' The global trade balance dictates that global production must be larger than or equal to global demand.
*' For non-traded goods, the regional production must be larger than or equal to regional demand.
