*' @description Within this realization, there are two ways for a region to fulfill
*' its demand for agricultural products: a self-sufficiency pool based on
*' historical region specific trade patterns, and a comparative advantage pool
*' based on most cost-efficient production.

*' In the self-sufficiency pool, regional self-sufficiency ratios `f21_self_suff_seedred_1995(i,k)` defines
*' how much of the demand of each region `i` for each traded goods `k_trade` has to be met by domestic production.
*' Self sufficiency ratios smaller than one indicate that the region imports from the world market,
*' while self-sufficiencies greater than one indicate that the region produces for export. Trade costs,
*' inlucding trade margins and tariffs, are considered.
*'

*' @limitations This realization depends on predetermined self-sufficiency rates and export shares,
*' which leads to a relative fixed trade pattern.
