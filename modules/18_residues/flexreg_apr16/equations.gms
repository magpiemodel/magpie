*' The AG crop residue biomass `vm_res_biomass_ag` is calculated as a function
*' of harvested area `vm_area` and production `vm_prod_reg`. `f18_cgf` contains
*' slope and intercept parameters of the CGFs.

*' In contrast to AG biomass, AG production `vm_res_biomass_ag(i,kcr,attributes)`
*' is defined as the part of residues which is removed from the field. The
*' difference between biomass and production is either burned on field or
*' remains on the fields (either incorporated in soils or not) and decays.
*' The field balance equations ensures that the production of AG residues
*' `vm_res_biomass_ag(i,kcr,attributes)` is properly assigned to different uses:
*' removal, on-field burning and recycling of AG residues.

*' The amount of residues burned on fields in a region `vm_res_ag_burn` is
*' determined by the share (ic18_res_use_min_shr) of AG residue biomass.
*' Based on @smil_nitrogen_1999, residue burning is fixed to 15% of total AG
*' crop residue dry matter in developed and 25% in developing regions for each
*' crop. For future time steps, these rates are scenario dependent, and either
*' kept constant or reduced to 10% and 0% in 2050.

*' While the residue biomass is estiamted with a crop-specific nutrient
*' composition (which is required for consistent nutrient budgets), the
*' removed residues are assumed to have homogeneous properties
*' (to reduce the number of commodities in MAgPIE) within three crop residue
*' groups (cereal straw, fibrous residues that cannot be digested
*' by monogastrics, and non-fibrous residues that can be digested).
*' The following constraint, in combination with the field balance equation,
*' guarantees that mass balances are not violated while a homogeneous
*' good is extracted from heterogeneous goods.

*' Residues recycled to croplands in nutrients `vm_res_recycling(i2,"nr")` are
*' calcualted based on the amount of AG residues left on field for recycling, the
*' nutrients coming from burned residues, and on biomass that is left in

*' module [50_nr_soil_budget].

*' Similar to the recycled nutrients, the potash recycling is determined by the
*' amount of AG residues with the potash content and the amounts of potash from
*' burning residues. As P and K are not volatile and hardly water soluble, only
*' removed aboveground crop residues have to be considered, while nutrients from
*' burned AG as well as BG stay on the field.

*' Costs of residues production are determined as factor costs per ton
*' assuming 15 USD per ton, using the lower range from
*' [this source](hwww1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$Department/deptdocs.nsf/All/faq7514),
*' 10USD baling costs per large round bale plus 2USD pro bale stocking and hauling,
*' 1 large round bale is approximately 500 kg, resulting in 24USD per ton,
*' for developing prices see [here](citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.557.5823&rep=rep1&type=pdf).
*' Tha calcuated factor costs per ton are therefore 24 for `res_cereals`, `res_fibrous`
*' and `res_nonfibrous`.
