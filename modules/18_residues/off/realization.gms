*' @description No representation of crop residues in the model. Residual biomass 
*' aboveground (`vm_res_biomass_ag`) and belowground (`vm_res_biomass_bg`) are set to 0, 
*' as well as biomass to be recycled (`vm_res_recycling`) or burned as agricultural 
*' residues (`vm_res_ag_burn`). Therefore, these types of crop residues are left unaccounted
*' for within any modules using these interface variable.

*' @limitations Should not be used if emission estimates are required or
*' climate policies are activated.
