*' Land transition matrix for peatland area.
*' The sum of current peatland area defined in `v58_lu_transitions` has to equal the sum of
*' peatland area in the previous time step (`pc58_peatland_man` + `pc58_peatland_intact`).
*' The two balancing variables `v58_balance_positive` and `v58_balance_negative` are needed
*' to avoid technical infeasibilities due to small differences in accuracy between
*' variables and parameters in GAMS. The use of `v58_balance_positive` and
*' `v58_balance_negative` is minimized by putting a high cost factor on these variables
*' (`q58_peatland_cost_full`). In practice, `v58_balance_positive` and
*' `v58_balance_negative`should deviate from zero only in exceptional cases.

*' Future peatland degradation (`v58_peatland_man`) depends on managed land (`vm_land`),
*' scaled with the ratio of total peatland area and total land area (`p58_scaling_factor`)
*' and a calibration factor (`p58_calib_factor`) for alignment with historic levels of degraded peatland.
*' By multiplying changes in managed land (`vm_land`) with the scaling factor we implicitly assume
*' that intact peatlands are distributed equally within a grid cell.
*' The following example illustrates the mechanism used for projecting peatland dynamics:
*' In a given grid cell, the total land area is 50 Mha and the total peatland area is 10 Mha.
*' Therefore, the scaling factor is 0.2 (10 Mha divided by 50 Mha).
*' If cropland expands by 5 Mha, 1 Mha of intact peatland is converted to degraded peatland (5 Mha*0.2).
*' If the total cell would become cropland, degraded peatland would equal to the total peatland area (50 Mha * 0.2 = 10 Mha).
