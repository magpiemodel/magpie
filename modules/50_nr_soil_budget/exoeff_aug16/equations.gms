*' For cropland the equation `q50_nr_bal_crp` balances the withdrawals of nitrogen with the share of all
*' incoming fluxes that can be uptaken by the crop.

*' q50_nr_inputs sums of all nitrogen inputs applied to croplands. Organic nitrogen inputs are
*' largely predefined by other modules.
*' Inorganic fertilizers are a free variable that allow to balance the nutrient inputs with requirements.
