*' We first need to transform the MACC curves from a format where they are a function
*' of inputs (approach 1, IPCC) to a function of losses (approach 2, MAgPIE).
*' Approach 2 is more consistent, as emissions can only come from losses, and
*' in the case of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE=I/H), losses (L=I-H) are zero,
*' but approach 1 would still come up with positive emissions.
*' The two approaches (see module 51_nitrogen) are
*' (1) E_1 = I_1 * EF * (1-MACCs1)
*' (2) E_2 = I_2 * (1-NUE2) / (1-NUE_ef) * EF
*' with the further condition:
*' (3) H=I_i*NUE_i
*' (4) (1-NUE2) = (1-NUEb)*(1-MaccsT)
*' E: emissions, I: nutrient inputs, EF: emission factor,
*' NUE: nitrogen use efficiency, H: harvested N
*' NUE_ef: the nitrogen use efficiency for which the EF is made
*'
*' We want to derive MaccsT under the condition that the measured reduction of
*' emissions (R = E/Eb) in both approaches remains equal.
*' combining 1+3 and 2+3

*' (4) R_1 = H/NUEb * EF * (1-MACCs1) / (H/NUEb * EF)
*' (5) R_2 = (H/NUE2 * (1-NUE2) / (1-NUE_ef) * EF) / (H/NUEb * (1-NUEb) / (1-NUE_ef) * EF)
*' (4+5) MACCsT = MACCs1*NUEb / (1 + MACCs1 * (NUEb - 1))

*' If the MACCs are expressed relative to a changing emission factor, this could
*' be accomodated in equation 4. Currently we assume a constant emission factor
*' implicit to the MACCs.
*' The year of NUE_base2 should be fixed to the baseyear efficiency, as
*' alternative "baseline" improvements would otherwise not reduce the
*' mitigation potential of the MACCs.
*' If the MACCs relate to a global emission factor NUEb should be the global
*' NUE, otherwise the regional NUE.
*' The name of the MACC category "inorg_fert_n2o" actually includes all types
*' of soil N2O emissions. Most of these measures also reduce general Nr surpluses.
*' We therefor apply it here to Nr soil efficiency more generally.

*' After transformation of the MACCs, we can calculate NUE_2 (vm_nr_eff) as the
*' result of a baseline NUE improvement and an MACC-driven further increase of NUE.
*' The nitrogen use efficiency is the inverse of the nitrogen loss share.
*' The loss share is estimated as a baseline loss share that describes the
*' baseline technological improvement of NUE, and a reduction of this loss
*' share by technical mitigation.
*' We assume that the MACCs reduce the remaining losses proportional, so that
*' emissions cannot become negative, and the baseline improvement reduces the
*' mitigation potential of the MACCs.
