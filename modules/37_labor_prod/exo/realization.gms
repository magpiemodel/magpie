*' @description This realization accounts for climate change impacts on 
*' labor productivity, based on ESM experiments from the LAMACLIMA project 
*' <https://climateanalytics.org/projects/lamaclima/>. 
*' Heat‚Äêinduced impacts on labor productivity have been calculated using the 
*' methodology described in @orlov_labor_2021.
*' Heat-induced impacts on labor productivity are available for two different metrics 
*' (HOTHAPS and ISO) and work intensity levels (300W and 400W).
*' The Hothaps function describes the relationship between workability and the 
*' wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT).
*' WBGT is a heat index that measures heat stress impacts of 
*' temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation.
*' The ISO standards describe the frequency and duration of rest breaks at work 
*' under different levels of heat stress.
*' Work intensity: 300W and 400W stand for the level of work intensity measured in 
*' Watts (W), at which the impacts are estimated. The higher work intensity, 
*' the stronger is the heat exposure. For instance, the impacts of heatstress 
*' on labor productivity under 300W are less than under 400W. 
*' In previous studies, the level of work intensity in agriculture is assumed to be 400W. 
*' However, work intensity differs by region due to different levels of mechanization. 
*' While 400W is plausible for manual work, mechanized work is less labor intensity. 
*'
*' @limitations Climate change impacts on labor productivity are currently only 
*'				available for RCP1.9 and RCP8.5.
