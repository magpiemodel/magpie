*' @description
*' The cellpool_aug16 realization is built on the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for
*' National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (@ipcc_2006_2006.). It calculates the loss of
*' soil carbon due to cropping activities and management based on stock change factors,
*' compared to potential natural vegetation.
*' This approach also accounts for the temporal dimension of soil organic carbon change,
*' since it assumes a gradual step of 15% in the direction of the new equilibrium soil
*' organic carbon pool each year. Stock change factors tracks crop types as well as
*' management (e.g. irrigation) and input differences on cropland. 

*' @limitations It is assumed that pastures and rangelandes as well as managed forests
*' do not change in soil carbon compared to the natural reference state.
