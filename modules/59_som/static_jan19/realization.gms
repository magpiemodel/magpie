*' @description The static_jan19 realization is built on the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for
*' National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (@ipcc_2006_2006.). It calculates the loss of
*' soil carbon due to cropping activities based on stock change factors, compared to
*' potential natural vegetation.
*' This approach does not account for the temporal dimension of soil organic carbon change,
*' since it assumes a complete loss of carbon directly after land conversion to cropland.
*' Therefore, no release of nitrogen due to soil organic matter loss is calculated.
*' Moreover only one stock change factor for all crop types is used, neglecting
*' e.g. differences for annual and perennial crops.

*' @limitations The soil carbon dynamics are instantaneous and do not account
*' for any time dependent release of soil carbon.
*' The soil carbon pools on cropland are not crop type specific.
*' The release of nitrogen due to soil organic matter loss is not calculated.
*' It is assumed that pastures and rangelands as well as managed forests
*' do not change in soil carbon compared to the natural reference state.
