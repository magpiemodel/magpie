*' @title Disaggregation of livestock distribution
*'
*' @description The module 71_disagg_lvst calculates the livestock distribution within a region onto
*' cellular level. Without constrains in this module cellular livestock production is determined by
*' the modules 40_transport accounting for transport costs and module 42_water_demand connecting
*' livestock production to water demand and thus to water availability.
