*' @description  This realization calculates use the results from @poulter2018global
*' for secondary forests (and timber plantations) based on MODIS satellite data.
*' This is used in [32_forestry] and [35_natveg] for initialization of forest areas
*' based on specification of endogenous (or exogenous) forest harvests. These numbers
*' are the most consistent dataset available on spatial scale and are preferred over
*' extarcting such numbers from LUH data due to ease of generating these numbers.

*' @limitations Forest fires change how the age structures of secondary or
*' human-intervention forests over time. This being a satellite observation data
*' probably includes such disturbances. These disturbances are not modeled extensively
*' in MAgPIE and hence using these numbers directly in the model might generate biases.
