* Ben Poulter age class distribution
im_plantedclass_ac(j,ac)  = 0;
*im_plantedclass_ac(j,ac)  = sum(ac_poulter_to_ac(ac_poulter,ac),f29_forestageclasses(j,ac_poulter)$(not sameas(ac_poulter,"class15")));
im_plantedclass_ac(j,ac)  = sum(ac_poulter_to_ac(ac_poulter,ac),f29_forestageclasses(j,ac_poulter));

* As summing over makes double counting (two magpie age classes in one poulter class)
* We divide by 2
im_plantedclass_ac(j,ac)  = im_plantedclass_ac(j,ac) /2;
