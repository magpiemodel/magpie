*' @title Material
*'
*' @description
*' The material module describes the demand for material usage
*' based on historical data. Material uage is derived from FAO's "other utils"
*' category, and includes for example the use of agricultural products
*' for cosmetics, chemical usage or textiles. In contrast to FAO's other util
*' category, the use for bioenergy (oils and ethanol) has been excluded
*' and is accounted for in the demand for bioenergy. Material demand in this
*' context can be considered as a subset of "other utils" category of FAO.
