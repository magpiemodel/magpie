*' @description
*' In the exo_flexreg_apr16 realisation, demand for material usage
*' is estimated to grow proportional to food demand calculated by `vm_dem_food` interface
*' in food module([15_food]). Observed material demand is fed as an input to the
*' material module based on historical data. The assumption that material demand
*' grows proportional to food demand is a simplification that can be justified
*' by the minor importance of non-bioenergy material usage of agricultural products.
