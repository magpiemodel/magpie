*' Estimation of material demand depends on the value set by switch
*' `s62_historical`. When it is set to 1, the material demand is estimated
*' purely based on the historical material demand as reported by FAO.
*' When `s62_historical` is switched to 0, the Material demand is calculated
*' as the scaled version of material demand in last historical timestep
*' depending on a scaling factor. This scaling factor is calculated as the
*' ratio beween the food demand from last timestep and the food demand from
*' the last historical time step. If an exogenous target for bioplastic production
*' is set, increasing material demand (substrate) for bioplastic production is included. 
*' For historic years it is assumed that this demand is already part of the
*' general material demand, therefore the double-counted demand is subtracted.
