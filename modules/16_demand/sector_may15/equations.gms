*' Not all demands are relevant for each product group therefore we distinguish
*' into diverse product groups and demand types, according to the equations
*' below. Supply balance for crops, livestock, secondary products and crop
*' residues are calculated as the summation of the corresponding demand for
*' food, feed, processing products, material, bioenergy, seed, waste and the
*' domestic balance flow. Demand for seed, waste and the domestic balance flow
*' are calculated internally within the [16_demand] module, while the other
*' relevant demand values are taken from other modules (see interface plot).
