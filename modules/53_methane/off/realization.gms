*' @description No representation of methane emissions within the model. While unrealistic, this 
*' realization may be useful for comparisons and completeness. When used, this realization
*' sets all emissions from enteric fermentation, animal waste management, rice cultivation, and
*' agricultural residue burning to 0.

*' @limitations It is unrealistic to consider zero methane emissions and to ignore it from a model
*' such as MAgPIE which is meant to assess impacts of agricultural production on environment.
