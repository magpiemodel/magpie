*' Total demand for bioenergy comes from different origins
*' 1st generation bioenergy demand is a fixed trajectory of minimum production
*' requirements. Second generation bioenergy splits into a Demand
*' for dedicated bioenergy crops, which are fully substitutable based on their
*' energy content, and residues which are also fully substitutable based on
*' their energy content.

*' The used first generation bioenergy trajectory contains demand until 2050
*' based on currently established and planned bioenergy policies
*' (@lotze-campen_impacts_2014). For the time
*' after 2050 it is assumed that bioenergy production will be fully transformed
*' to 2nd generation bioenergy crops and residues because of their higher
*' estimated efficiency respectively their low costs.
*'
*' For second generation bioenergy from dedicated bioenergy crops
*' (`kbe60` = bioenergy grasses and bioenergy
*' trees), input is given either on regional or global level (defined via switch
*' $c60\_biodem\_level$). As the bioenergy demand for all crop types was fixed in the
*' first step it now has to be released again for second generation bioenergy
*' crops (`kbe60`).
*'
*' The bioenergy demand calculation for second generation bioenergy is based on
*' the following two equations from which always only one is active:
*' If $c60\_biodem\_level$ is 1 (regional) the right hand side of the first equation
*' is set to 0, if it is 0 (global) the right hand side of the second equation
*' is set to 0.

                    =g= sum(ct,i60_bioenergy_dem(ct,i2))*c60_biodem_level;

*' Except the implementation of the switches and the fact that in the first
*' equation the bioenergy demand is summed up to a global demand both equations
*' act the same way: In both cases the equation just makes sure that the sum
*' over all second generation energy crop of the bioenergy demand is greater or
*' equal to the demand actually given by the input file $i60\_bioenergy\_dem$.

*' There is additionally some demand of residues for second generation bioenergy
*' $i60\_res\_2ndgenBE\_dem$, which is exogenously provided by the estimation that
*' roughly 33% of available residues for recycling on cropland can be used for 2nd
*' generation bioenergy depending on the SSP scenario, since residue stock and use
*' is mainly driven by population and GDP.

*' Finally, an incentive is provided for the production of 1st generation
*' bioenergy from oils and ethanol even beyond the exogeneous minimum demand.
*' The incentive is kept low, but should provide a more realistic
*' overproduction from couple products.
