*' The total land requirements for cropland are calculated as
*' the sum of crop and water supply type specific land requirements.
*' Fallow is no explicit landuse type, but the difference between
*' land and harvested vm_area

 q30_cropland(j2)  ..
   sum((kcr,w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w)) + vm_fallow(j2) =e= vm_land(j2,"crop");


*' We assume that crop production can only take place on suitable cropland area.
*' We use a suitability index (SI) map from @zabel_global_2014 to exclude areas
*' from cropland production that have a low suitability, e.g. due to steep slopes,
*' to estimate the available cropland area. The cultivated area therefore has
*' to be smaller than the available cropland area. Moreover, the available cropland
*' can be reduced by constraining the cropland area in favour of other land types,
*' in order to increase compositional heterogeneity of land types at the cell level.

 q30_avl_cropland(j2) ..
   vm_land(j2,"crop") =l= sum(ct, p30_avl_cropland(ct,j2));

*' The semi-natural land constraint in cropland areas for sustaining critical regulating NCP
*' for agricultural production is added on top of land conserved for other reasons
*' (e.g. conservation of intact ecosystems or protection of biodiversity hotspots).
 q30_land_snv(j2) ..
            sum(land_snv, vm_land(j2,land_snv))
            =g=
            sum(ct, p30_snv_shr(ct,j2)) * vm_land(j2,"crop")
          + sum((ct,land_snv,consv_type), pm_land_conservation(ct,j2,land_snv,consv_type));

*' Rotational constraints prevent over-specialization. In this module realization,
*' they are implemented via a penalty payment if the constraints are violated.

q30_rotation_penalty(i2) ..
  vm_rotation_penalty(i2)
  =g=
  sum(cell(i2,j2),
    sum(rota30, v30_penalty(j2,rota30) * sum(ct, i30_rotation_incentives(ct,rota30)))
    + sum(rotamax_red30, v30_penalty_max_irrig(j2,rotamax_red30) * sum(ct, i30_rotation_incentives(ct,rotamax_red30)))
  );

*' The penalty applies to the areas which exceed a certain maximum
*' share of the land. Below this share, negative benefits are
*' avoided by defining the penalty to be positive.

 q30_rotation_max(j2,rotamax_red30) ..
   v30_penalty(j2,rotamax_red30)
   =g=
   sum((rota_kcr30(rotamax_red30,kcr),w),vm_area(j2,kcr,w))
   - vm_land(j2,"crop") * f30_rotation_rules(rotamax_red30);

*' Minimum constraints apply penalties when a certain mimimum
*' share of a group is not achieved. This is used to guarantee a minimum
*' crop group diversity withing cells.

 q30_rotation_min(j2,rotamin_red30) ..
    v30_penalty(j2,rotamin_red30)
    =g=
    vm_land(j2,"crop") * f30_rotation_rules(rotamin_red30)
    - sum((rota_kcr30(rotamin_red30,kcr),w), vm_area(j2,kcr,w));

*' The following maximum constraint avoids over-specialization in irrigated systems.
*' No minimum constraint is included for irrigated areas for computational
*' reasons. Minimum constraints just need to be met on total areas.

 q30_rotation_max_irrig(j2,rotamax_red30) ..
   v30_penalty_max_irrig(j2,rotamax_red30)
   =g=
   sum((rota_kcr30(rotamax_red30,kcr)), vm_area(j2,kcr,"irrigated"))
   - vm_AEI(j2) * f30_rotation_rules(rotamax_red30);


*' Agricultural production is calculated by multiplying the area under
*' production with corresponding yields. Production from rainfed and irrigated
*' areas is summed up:

 q30_prod(j2,kcr) ..
  vm_prod(j2,kcr) =e= sum(w, vm_area(j2,kcr,w) * vm_yld(j2,kcr,w));

*' The carbon content of the above ground carbon pools are calculated as a total
*' for all cropland :

 q30_carbon(j2,ag_pools,stockType) ..
   vm_carbon_stock(j2,"crop",ag_pools,stockType) =e=
     m_carbon_stock(vm_land,fm_carbon_density,"crop");

*' The biodiversity value for cropland is calculated separately for annual and perennial crops:
 q30_bv_ann(j2,potnatveg) ..
          vm_bv(j2,"crop_ann",potnatveg)
 					=e=
 					sum((crop_ann30,w), vm_area(j2,crop_ann30,w)) * fm_bii_coeff("crop_ann",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);

*' perennial crops are calculated as difference, as they shall also include fallow land
 q30_bv_per(j2,potnatveg) ..
        vm_bv(j2,"crop_per",potnatveg)
 				=e=
 				(vm_land(j2,"crop") - sum((crop_ann30,w), vm_area(j2,crop_ann30,w)))
        * fm_bii_coeff("crop_per",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);
