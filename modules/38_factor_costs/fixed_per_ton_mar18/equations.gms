*' The factor requirement costs `vm_cost_prod` are  calculated as product of
*' production quantity `vm_prod_reg` and crop-specific world average
*' factor costs of production per volume `f38_fac_req_per_ton`.
*' The volume depending factor costs, which remains fixed overtime, are obtained
*' from value-added costs which correspond to the factor of production included
*' in this module from GTAP7 (@narayanan_gtap7_2008).
*' It worth to mention again that the factor costs in this module
*' do not include land rents (as MAgPIE calculates land rents endogenously),
*' chemical fertilizer costs (as they are calculated in [50_nr_soil_budget]
*' module), and costs of agricultural intermediate inputs such as seeds
*' (to avoid double counting in the model).
