*' Constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function for one unit of output.
*' The CES function accounts for capital `v38_capital_need` and labor `v38_laborhours_need` requirements.
*' The efficiency of labor is affected by the labor productivity factor `pm_labor_prod` based on climate 
*' change impacts, which is provided by the labor productivity module [37_labor_prod], and by the factor 
*' `pm_productivity_gain_from_wages` based on increased wages from [36_employment].
*' The calculation of total capital and labor costs is covered by the equations `q38_cost_prod_crop` and `q38_cost_prod_inv`.
*' The conceptual and analytical details of the CES function including the labor productivity factor are documented in @orlov_ces_2021.
