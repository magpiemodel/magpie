*' @title Factor Costs

*' @description This module is used to calculate factor costs of production in
*' crop activities. The costs of factors of production included in this module
*' are specifically of labor, capital, and energy and related costs. The costs
*' are crop-specific, and pass to the the cost function in [11_costs].
*' Thus, factor costs will contribute to and influence the choice of production
*' pattern in the model.
