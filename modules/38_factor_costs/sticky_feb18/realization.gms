*' @description The main goal of this realization is to improve crop patterns at different spatial
*' scales. Specifically, the goal is reached by reducing capital relocation flexibility between
*' crop types. In the "sticky" realization, the factor costs are separated into variable and
*' capital investment costs. Then, capital is furtherly divided into immobile and mobile, where
*' mobility is defined between crops. In this way, changes in cropland are favored in locations
*' with existing capital stocks.

*' @limitations This realization assumes that factor costs, within a region,
*' purely depend on the production and are independent of the area under cultivation.
*' By implication, cases in which the harvested area could significantly influence
*' factors costs are hardly accounted in this realization.
