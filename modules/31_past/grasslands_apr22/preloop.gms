***YIELD CORRECTION ACCOUNTING FOR REGIONAL DIFFERENCES IN MANAGEMENT***

*' @code

*' Grassland yields for rangelands and managed pastures are calibrated to match estimated
*' historical pasture productivity.

*' The following equations calibrate the grassland cellular yield patterns ('f31_grassl_yld') to match
*' 'estimated historical yields' ('i31_grass_hist_yld') by calculating a calibration term called
*' 'i31_grass_calib'. For most cases, 'i31_grass_calib' is the ratio of the 'i31_grass_hist_yld'
*' and modeled yields ('i31_grass_modeled_yld') given historic grassland area patterns
*' ('i31_grassl_areas') and cellular yields coming from crop models like LPJmL 'f31_grassl_yld'.
*' In these cases, 'i31_grass_calib' represents a purely relative calibration factor that depends
*' only on the initial conditions of the starting year.
*'
*' However, when estimated yields 'i31_grass_hist_yld' are significantly higher than
*' given by the cellular yield inputs 'f31_grassl_yld' we refer to this as an underestimated
*' baseline. In this situation the relative calibration terms can lead to unrealistically
*' large yields in the case of future yield increases within the cellular yield patterns.
*'
*' To address this issue, we introduce the factor 'i31_lambda_grass' that determines the degree
*' to which the baseline 'i31_grass_hist_yld' is under- or overestimated by the modeled yields
*' 'i31_grass_modeled_yld'. This factor is used to control whether the calibration factor is
*' applied as an absolute or relative change. For 'i31_grass_hist_yld' smaller than
*' 'i31_grass_modeled_yld' (overestimated baseline) 'i31_lambda_grass' is 1, which is
*' equivalent to an entirely relative calibration. For underestimated yields, 'i31_lambda_grass'
*' is calculated as the squared root of the ratio between modeled yields 'i31_grass_modeled_yld'
*' and the historical estimates 'i31_grass_hist_yld'. For underestimated yields, as 'i31_lambda_grass'
*' approaches 0, it reduces the applied relative change resulting in a mean change increasingly
*' similar to an additive term (@Heinke.2013).

*' This concept is referred to as limited calibration, as it limits the calibration
*' to an additive term in case of a strongly underestimated baseline. The scalar
* 's31_limit_calib' can be used to switch limited calibration on (1) and off (0).
