*' Production of pasture biomass is restricted to pasture area which is
*' delivered as module output together with the resulting geographically
*' explicit production of pasture biomass. Cellular production is calculated by
*' multiplying pasture area `vm_land` with cellular rainfed pasture yields
*' `vm_yld` which are delivered by the module [14_yields]:

q31_prod(j2) ..
 vm_prod(j2,"pasture") =l= vm_land(j2,"past")
 						   * vm_yld(j2,"pasture","rainfed");

*' On the basis of the required pasture area, cellular above ground carbon stocks are calculated:

q31_carbon(j2,ag_pools) ..
 vm_carbon_stock(j2,"past",ag_pools) =e=
         sum(ct, vm_land(j2,"past")*fm_carbon_density(ct,j2,"past",ag_pools));

*' In the initial calibration time step, where the pasture calibration factor
*' is calculated that brings pasture biomass demand and pasture area in balance,
*' small costs are attributed to the production of pasture biomass in order to
*' avoid overproduction of pasture in the model:

q31_cost_prod_past(i2) ..
 vm_cost_prod(i2,"pasture") =e= vm_prod_reg(i2,"pasture")
 								* s31_fac_req_past;

*' For all following time steps, factor requriements `s31_fac_req_past` are set
*' to zero.

*' By estimating the different area of managed pasture and rangeland via the luh2 side layers, the biodiversity value for pastures and rangeland is calculated in following:
 q31_bv_manpast(j2,potnatveg) .. vm_bv(j2,"manpast",potnatveg)
 					=e=
 					vm_land(j2,"past") * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"manpast") * fm_bii_coeff("manpast",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);

 q31_bv_rangeland(j2,potnatveg) .. vm_bv(j2,"rangeland",potnatveg)
 					=e=
 					vm_land(j2,"past") * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,"rangeland") * fm_bii_coeff("rangeland",potnatveg) * fm_luh2_side_layers(j2,potnatveg);
