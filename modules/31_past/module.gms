*' @title Pasture
*'
*' @description The pasture module determines land used as pasture for livestock
*' rearing. At the same time, it calculates geographically explicit production
*' of pasture biomass and the carbon content of pasture land. Therefore, the
*' module requires cellular information about the carbon density related to the
*' different pasture carbon pools. Furthermore, it delivers regional production
*' costs associated with pastures and biodiversity values for pasture and rangeland.
