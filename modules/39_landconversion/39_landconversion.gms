*' @title Land Conversion Costs

*' @description The land conversion cost module calculates costs for the conversion
*' from one land type to another (e.g. conversion from forest to cropland).
*' Land conversion plays an important role for the overall model dynamics,
*' in particular in terms of CO2 emissions from land-use change.
*' Expansion of agricultural land is one of the major options in the model to increase 
*' agricultural production, besides yield increases ([13_tc], [14_yields]) and trade ([21_trade]).
