*Costs for single-cell protein production (scp) are accounted for separately in f20_scp_unitcosts (see 'q20_processing_costs').
*Separate accounting is needed because scp_hydrogen has no land requirements, and thus otherwise would have no costs.
*To avoid double accounting the processing costs of scp_methane, scp_sugar and scp_cellulose are set to zero.
i20_processing_unitcosts("scp",kpr) = 0;

*SCP can be produced via different routes. The processing shares for SCP are scenario dependent (c20_scp_type).
