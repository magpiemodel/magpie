*' Manure is estimated based on feed intake minus the NPK incorporated
*' in the biomass of the slaughtered animal.
*' We distinguish 4 general animal waste management systems based on
*' what animals eat and where their manure remains. For simplification,
*' we assume that pastures receive the manure of grazed biomass,
*' while croplands receive the manure of cropbased feed. In reality,
*' manure from grazing may be also excreted in stables and vice versa.
*' Problematic may be in particular that grass can also be harvested and
*' fed to animals in stables, and manure from confinements may be applied
*' also to pastures. As both practices mostly appear in high-income countries
*' and may also be causally linked (as nutrient deficits of pastures have to
*' be balanced if biomass is removed), we assume they cancel out.
*' We therefore distinguish only 4 categories:
*' a) confined animals which receive concentrate feed and crop residues

*' Please note that the share of residues fed via stubble grazing depends 
*' on the development state and has to be subtracted from the residues fed to confined animals. 
*' We assume that in developing regions 25% of residues are grazed by animals on stubble fields, 
*' whereas stubble grazing is assumed to not occur in developed regions.
		 
*' The manure is estimated by subtracting from feed a certain share which is
*' incorporated into animal biomass. This share depends on the productivity of
*' the animal and is calculated in the preprocessing, also for computational
*' reasons.
