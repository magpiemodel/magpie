*' Therefore, the equation below is used to estimate the mitigation costs.
*' MACC costs are calculated based on emissions BEFORE technical mitigation.
*' These emissions are here calculated back from the final emissions, using
*' the mitigated shares. Please note that in some cases (e.g. N2O emissions
*' from soils) there is an intended mismatch between the actual mitigated
*' quantities, and the quantities for which abatement has to be paid. As can
*' be seen in the respective emission module (e.g. 50_nr_soil_budget), the
*' mitigation quantity is reduced if baseline efficiencies are already high,
*' but the mitigation costs still apply fully, as the mitigation "effort"
*' is the same.
*' Mitigation costs are then calculated as the product of GHG emissions
*' before technical mitigation, and the costs per unit of technical mitigation.
*' The mitigation costs will go into the objective function of the model.

*' To avoid double-accounting, the fertilizer savings that reduce the costs of
*' the MACCs have to be added again to the MACCs, as the fertilizer costs are
*' endogenous in our model and fall with rising MACCs. We ex-post replicate
*' these implicit cost savings by assuming that they calculate the MACCs emission
*' savings proportional to fertilizer savings. Fertilization quantity is derived by
*' calculating emissions back to fertilization using the default emission factor
*' by the IPCC that is likely the basis for their estimates (E=F*EF, F= E/EF).

*' Costs are assumed to be factor costs and split into a labor and a capital part.
*' The labor share is scaled according to the changes in wages and corresponding 
*' productivity change.
