*' Therefore, the equation below is used to estimate the mitigation costs.
*' It is simply calculated as a product of GHG emissions before technical mitigation (`vm_btm_reg`), 
*' and the costs per unit of technical mitigation (`p57_maccs_costs_integral`).
*' The mitigation costs will go into the objective function of the model.
