*' @title Marginal Abatement Cost Curves
*'
*' @description This module describes technical mitigation of GHG emissions.
*' It allows to reduce GHG emissions by undertaking mitigation
*' measures in exchange for additional mitigation costs.
*' The technical mitigation measures include, for example, better spreader maintenance,
*' feed additives or investments in animal waste management facilities.
*' Please note that technical mitigation is possible only in the "on" module realization below.
*' For simplicity, we considered only the effects of mitigation measure costs and emissions.
*' Their direct consequences on biophysical values like yields or water requirements is ignored at the moment.
*'
*' Mitigation costs are estimated using marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs).
*' The curves are applied on the original emissions before technical mitigation (btm),
*' and reduce them by a certain percentage in exchange for additional costs.
*' The MACCs used in this module are based on the data from @LUCAS200785.
