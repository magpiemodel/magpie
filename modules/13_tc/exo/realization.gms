*' @description The exo realization stands for exogenous implementation of
*' technological change and land use intensification. The equations and structure 
*' are similar to the endo realization, with the difference that all variables are fixed.
*' The idea of exo realization is to prescribe intensification rates based 
*' on model runs with the endo realization. For instance, the endogenously derived 
*' intensification rates for a SSP2 baseline run can be used as exogenous input for 
*' a SSP2 policy run. The tau function in the magpie4 R package can be used to 
*' generate the file f13_tau_scenario.csv, which is region and time specific, based on 
*' an existing model run: tau(gdx,file="f13_tau_scenario.csv"). This file should then be
*' copied to the input folder (overwrite the existing dummy file f13_tau_scenario.csv).


*' @limitations TC is not allowed to adapt to the given demand requirements.This realization
*' might result in infeasibilities if the scenario setup diverges too much from the scenario
*' setup used to generate the file f13_tau_scenario.csv. If the pressure in the system is 
*' too high, the tau factors provided in the file f13_tau_scenario.csv might be insufficient
*' to solve the model.
