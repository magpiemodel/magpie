*' @description Urban Land based on LUH2v2 (Hurtt 2020) cellular (0.5 degree) input dataset, varying with SSP. 
*' Cellular level is prescribed via a very high punishment term for deviating from original input values.
*' Regional sums of urban land must add be equal for both model and input data.

*' @limitations Urban land is exogenous and does not interact with other model dynamics, except for reducing available non-urban land pool.
*'  Cellular urban land may not exactly match input data due to other land needs in the same cell.
