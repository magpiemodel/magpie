*' The total regional production cost calculation is based on the sum of different
*' MAgPIE production activities. These individual costs are calculated by various
*' cost interfaces, which are in turn calculated inside their respective modules.
*' Different components of regional costs are as follows:
*' Factor costs ([38_factor_costs]),
*' land conversion costs ([39_landconversion]),
*' Transportation costs ([40_transport]),
*' Technological costs ([13_tc]),
*' Inorganic fertilizers ([50_nr_soil_budget]),
*' Emission costs ([56_ghg_policy]),
*' Rewarded CDR from afforestation (Benefits as negative costs) ([56_ghg_policy]),
*' Abatement costs ([57_maccs]),
*' Irrigation expansion costs ([41_area_equipped_for_irrigation]),
*' Trade costs (Transport and bilateral trade) ([21_trade]),
*' Forestry related costs (afforestation) ([32_forestry]),
*' Bioenergy costs ([60_bioenergy]),
*' Processing costs ([20_processing]),
*' Punish costs for overrate cropland differences ([59_som]).
