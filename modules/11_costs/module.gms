*' @title Costs
*'
*' @description The cost module determines the sum total of global production
*' costs in each time step. MAgPIE's objective is to minimize the global cost of
*' production in a recursive dynamic way. The interface variable `vm_cost_glo`
*' is used for this purpose. The model optimizes the production activities
*' accordingly to ensure that all the demand and supply constraints are met
*' while minimizing the global production costs.
