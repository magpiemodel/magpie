*The following bounds should be moved to the respective land modules in the future (different bounds for different realizations)

*' @code Some of the land use transitions are restricted:

*' No planted forest on natveg areas
vm_lu_transitions.fx(j,"primforest","forestry") = 0;

*' Conversions within natveg are not allowed
vm_lu_transitions.fx(j,"primforest","other") = 0;
vm_lu_transitions.fx(j,"secdforest","other") = 0;

*' Primforest can only decrease
vm_lu_transitions.fx(j,land_from,"primforest") = 0;
vm_lu_transitions.up(j,"primforest","primforest") = Inf;

*' @stop
