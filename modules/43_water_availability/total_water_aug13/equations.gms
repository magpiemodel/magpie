*' @description The water constraint, `q43_water`, assures that, in each
*' cluster, the sum of water withdrawals in all sectors `vm_watdem`
*' does not exceed available water from all sources `v43_watavail`.
*' The local seasonal water constraints is the sum of the amount of water needed
*' in the sectors defined by `wat_dem` (agriculture, industry, electricity,
*' domestic and ecosystem). This value must be lower than the sum of the Amount of
*' water available from different sources in the sectors defined by `wat_src` (surface,
*' ground, technical and renewable groundwater).
