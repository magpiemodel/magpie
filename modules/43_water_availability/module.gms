*' in MAgPIE. The following water sources are currently implemented: surface water, 
*' groundwater, technical (like desalination etc.). Additionally, 
*' this module includes the main water constraint that requires water withdrawals 
*' to be smaller or equal to available water. Information is passed to and received
