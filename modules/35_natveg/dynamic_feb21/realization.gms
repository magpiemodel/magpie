*' @description In the dynamic_feb21 realization, land and carbon stock dynamics
*' of natural vegetation are modeled endogenously.
*' The initial spatial distribution of the sub-land-types primary forest,
*' secondary forest and other natural land is based on the
*' LUH2 data set [@hurtt2018luh2].
*' This realization also includes national policies implemented (NPI) and nationally
*' determined contributions to the Paris agreement (NDC) with regard to forest and other
*' land protection. The NPI/NDC polices ramp up until 2030 and are assumed constant
*' thereafter. NPI/NDC land conservation polices are applied on forest and other land,
*' depending on individual country reports. The NPI/NDC policies are treated as minimum
*' constraints and therefore are non-additive, if the land protection targets as provided by
*' the module `22_land_conservation` and the interface `pm_land_conservation` are larger.
*' Additionally, this module includes forest damage and provides the ability to
*' harvest natural vegetation for timber. Both wood and woodfuel can be produceed
*' from primary and secondary forest but other land is only allowed to be harvested
*' for woodfuel.
*' @stop

*'
*' @limitations Initialization of both primary and secondary forest in highest
*' age class or equal distrivution of such areas in all age classes. Data exists
*' on a more emperically obtained distribution in different age classes based
*' on satellite data but this results is highly negative land-use change emissions.
*' Inclusion of this data in MAgPIE remains work in progess and is not available for release yet.
*' Additionally, in this module realization, harvested secondary forest stays
*' secondary forest and harvested primary forest is reclassified as secondary forest.
