*' @description  This realization aggregates agricultural production from
*' cluster level `j` to regional level `i`. Currently, cluster level production
*' is available only for plant commodities, i.e for crops and pastures.
*' Cluster level production of different crops and pasture is calculated in
*' module [30_crop] and [31_past] respectively.

*' @limitations For the time being, this approach is not applied to livestock
*' products.
