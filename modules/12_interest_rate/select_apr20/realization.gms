*' @description The select_apr20 realization allows to flexibly choose regional
*' or global interest rates. In the default setting, the interest rate depends
*' on the development state `im_development_state`, which is calculated based
*' on GDP per capita. Thus, interest rates are regionally specific and dynamic
*' over time.
*' Alternative interest rates can be selected via the interest rate coefficients
*' (`s12_interest_lic`, `s12_interest_hic`, `s12_hist_interest_lic`, `s12_hist_interest_hic`).
*' The future interest rate policy fades in starting from 2025 until it is fully
*' in effect by 2050.
*' It is also possible to choose a global interest rate.
