*' Demand for different feed items is derived by multiplying the regional
*' livestock production with the respective feed baskets. Additionally,
*' inconsistencies with the FAO inventory of national feed use in the case of
*' crops as well as consideration of alternative feed sources that reduce e.g.
*' the demand for grazed biomass like scavenging and roadside grazing are
*' balanced out by the parameter `fm_feed_balanceflow`.

*' Factor requirement costs (e.g. labour, capital, but without costs for feed)
*' of livestock production depend on the amount of production and the per-unit
*' costs. For ruminant products (milk and meet), we use a regression of per-unit
*' factor costs from the GTAP database [@narayanan_gtap7_2008] and livestock
*' productivity. Here, factor costs rise with intensification. The per-unit
*' costs for non-ruminants and fish are assumed to be independent from
*' productivity trajectories for simplification. Therefore,
*' `i70_cost_regr(i,kli,"cost_regr_b")` is set to zero in the case of livestock
*' products generated in monogastric systems.

*' To account for increased hourly labor costs and producitivity in case of an external 
*' wage scenario, the total labor costs are scaled by the corresponding increase in hourly
*' labor costs and the related productivity gain from [36_employment].
