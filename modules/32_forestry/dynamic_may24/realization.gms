*' @description The main features of the this realization are re/afforestation for CDR
*' and timber production. Re/afforestation can be modelled exogenously (prescribed
*' by NPI/NDC policies) and/or endogenously (incentivized by a reward for CDR).
*' National policies implemented (NPI) and nationally determined contributions to
*' the Paris agreement (NDC) for re/afforestation are based on country reports. The
*' interface `vm_cdr_aff` includes the expected CDR and local bph effects from
*' re/afforestation depending on the planning horizon `s32_planning_horizon`. The
*' reward for CDR and local bph effects from re/afforestation is calculated in the
*' [56_ghg_policy] module. In this realization, re/afforestation is modeled by default
*' as regrowth of natural vegetation (see @humpenoder_investigating_2014 for details on the implemenation).
*' The regrowth of natural vegetation follows S-shaped growth curves, which are
*' parametrized based on @braakhekke_modelling_2019. Additionally this module
*' handles the production of two timber products i.e., wood and woodfuel from
*' plantation forests while still accounting for afforestation policies. New plantations
*' are also established in the simulation step to account for future timber demand.
*' This module also calculates the rotation lengths before the solve loop by
*' maximizing current annual increment (CAI) based on @amacher2009economics. This rotation
*' length calculation decision can also be changed to maximization of mean annual increment (MAI)
*' or equating instantaneous growth rate (IGR) with interest rate. Rotation lengths
*' calculated by maximization of CAI are empirically closer to economically optimal Faustmann
*' rotation lengths (see @amacher2009economics).
*' For harvesting decisions we assume that land owners stick to their establishment decision,
*' e.g. if a plantation has been established with a rotation length of 30 years
*' it will be harvested after 30 years, even so the rotation length in the prevailing
*' time step, used for establishment, is shorter or longer. See @mishra_forestry_2021 for more details.

*' @limitations Rotation lengths for timber plantations are not endogenous.
