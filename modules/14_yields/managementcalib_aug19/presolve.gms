* calculate carbon density

*** YIELDS

*` `pm_carbon_density_ac_forestry` for vegetation Carbon is above- and belowground
*' carbon density. We convert Carbon density in tC/ha to tDM/ha by using carbon
*' fraction of `s14_carbon_fraction` in tC/tDM. For assessing wood harvesting
*' we need only aboveground biomass information, therefore we multiply with
*' aboveground `f14_aboveground_fraction`. Additionally, we divide aboveground
*' tree biomass by biomass conversion and expansion (BCE) factor to get stem
*' biomass in tDM/ha.
