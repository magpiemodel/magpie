*' Above constraint transforms the fooduse of agricultural products into per capita
*' food demand.
*' `vm_dem_food` is the fooduse of agricultural products. It is measured in tons
*' of dry matter prior to processing. The multiplication with the nutrition attributes
*' provides the equivalent in calories. While nutrition attributes are assumed
*' to be globally the same
*' (assumption of homogeneous products), a regional balance flow is used to account
*' for current differences in food processing, where some regions get different calories
*' from the same fooduse quantitiy. Depending on the input data, the balance flow
*' may fade out in the future, which implies actual homogeneous products.

*' The subsequent equations belong to the standalone food demand model, which is
*' executed before MAgPIE or iterated with MAgPIE. They are excluded from the run
*' of MAgPIE itself.

          ;

*' In principle, the food demand model has only one solution that satifies all
*' equations. Technically, the objective could therefore be chosen arbirtrarily,
*' for the solver to find the single solution.
*' However, if the model is executed outside its domain
*' (e.g. with extreme price shocks), it can happen that real income takes a
*' negative value (because the increase in food value exceeds the available income).
*' To avoid this case, a punishment term `v15_income_balance` is introduced. It
*' increases the real income, but affects the maximized objective variable
*' negatively, disincentivizing its use in cases where it is not needed.

         + sum(ct,im_gdp_pc_ppp_iso(ct,iso)) + v15_income_balance(iso);

*' The budget constraint calculates the real income after a possible price
*' shock. The basic assumption is that increasing prices reduce real income,
*' while decreasing prices increase real income.
*' Through this income effect, higher prices reduce the food demand.
*' The income before the food price shock is `im_gdp_pc_ppp_iso`.
*' It is reduced by the change in value of the demanded calories under changed
*' prices.
*' In the following, the real income is used to determine food intake,
*' food demand as well as dietary composition.

*' The BMI distribution within the population is calculated using
*' regressions in a hierachical tree to estimate the share of the population
*' falling into a certain BMI class.
*' ![Hierarchical tree used to estimate BMI population shares](hierarchical_tree.png){ width=100% }

*' First, the regression shares are calculated:
