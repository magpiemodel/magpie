*' @description
*' The realization anthropometrics_jan18
*' uses per capita income and the demography of the
*' world population (including sex and age classes at the country level,
*' which are provided from module [09_drivers]) as drivers.
*' The module estimates food demand on iso-country level taking
*' anthropometric food requirements as well as economic dynamics into account.
*' If flexible demand is activated, the module also uses the shadow prices
*' for agircultural products from the optimization, which are the Lagrange
*' multipliers of the constraint `q15_food_demand`.
*' The module consists of a standalone food demand model, which is executed
*' before MAgPIE starts. In the case of endogenous demand, the module is
*' iterated with MAgPIE.
*' Besides providing the fooduse of agricultural products, the model also
*' provides a number of output indicators, including the BMI distribution,
*' body weight and height of the population by age and sex, food intake by
*' age group and sex, food waste, dietary composition between livestock products,
*' empty calories (sugar, oil and alcohol), fruits vegetables and nuts, as well
*' as staple calories.
*' The food demand model can be run in standalone mode by running the
*' the file `standalone/demand_model.gms`.
*' The model is described in [@bodirsky_starved_nodate]
