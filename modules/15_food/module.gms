*' @title Food demand
*'
*' @description The food demand module forecasts the food demand vm_dem_food for
*' various agricultural products, which is used in the module [16_demand].
*' Drivers of food demand are population, income, and demographic structure from
*' module [09_drivers], as well as module-specific scenario assumptions.
*' In the case of elastic demand, the model uses the shadow price of
*' agricultural commodities q15_food_demand.m to change food demand and iterates
*' with MAgPIE until a common solution is found. Outputs include next to food
*' demand also projections of anthropometric parameters such as body height and
*' weight distribution, as well as phyiscal activity levels.
