*' @title MAgPIE - Modelling Framework
*'
*' @description The *Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the
*' Environment* (MAgPIE) is developed and used to assess the competition for
*' land and water and the associated consequences for sustainable development
*' under future scenarios of rising food, energy and material demand as well
*' as production, climate change impacts and greenhouse gas mitigation and
*' different land related policies (@dietrich_magpie4).
*'
*' MAgPIE is a global partial equilibrium model of the land-use sector that operates
*' in a recursive dynamic mode and incorporates spatially explicit information on
*' biophysical constraints into an economic decision making process (@lotze-campen_global_2008).
*' It takes regional economic conditions such as elastic demand for agricultural commodities,
*' technological development and production costs as well as spatially explicit data on biophysical
*' constraints into account. Geographically explicit data on biophysical conditions are provided
*' by the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed land model (LPJmL) (@bondeau_lpjml_2007, @mueller_projecting_2014)
*' on a 0.5 degree resolution and include e.g. carbon densities of different vegetation types,
*' agricultural productivity such as crop yields and water availability for irrigation. Based on
*' the strong interaction with LPJmL, MAgPIE can also help to assess the consequences of climate
*' change and increased CO2 in the atmosphere on the land-use sector (@stevanovic_impact_2016)
*'
*' Available land types in MAgPIE are cropland, pasture area, forest, other land
*' (including non-forest natural vegetation, abandoned agricultural land and deserts)
*' and settlements. Cropland (rainfed and irrigated), pasture, forest and other land
*' are endogenously determined, while settlement areas are assumed to be constant over time.
*' The cropland covers cultivation of different crop types (e.g. temperate and tropical
*' cereals, maize, rice, oilseeds, roots), both rainfed and irrigated systems, and two
*' 2nd generation bioenergy crop types (grassy and woody).
*'
*' Taking into account international trade based on historical trade patterns and economic
*' competitiveness ([21_trade]), global production has to meet demand for food,
*' feed, seed, processing, bioenergy and material demand ([16_demand]). Food demand is
*' derived based on population growth ([09_drivers]) and dietary transitions, accounting
*' for changes in intake and food waste, the shift in the share of animal calories,
*' processed products, fruits and vegetables as well as staples ([15_food]).
*' Primary products can be processed to secondary products such as sugar, oil
*' or ethanol ([20_processing]). The quantity of livestock production in
*' combination with dynamic regional and livestock-specific feed baskets determines the
*' demand for feed ([70_livestock]). The supply of animal-based food commodities is divided into five livestock production
*' activities (ruminant meat, pig meat, poultry meat, eggs and milk) (@weindl_livestock_2017-1).
*' The spatial distribution of crops ([30_crop]), livestock ([71_disagg_lvst])
*' and pasture ([31_past]) in MAgPIE is guided by geographically explicit
*' information on vegetation growth and the balance between crop water
*' demand and water availability, by initial land cover distribution maps
*' as well as by economic conditions like trade barriers ([21_trade]), management intensity ([13_tc])
*' and transport costs ([40_transport]). It therefore integrates information about market access into
*' the model's optimization process that determines where cropping activities and livestock production
*' are allocated to. Parts of forests and other natural land area can be excluded from conversion into
*' agricultural land if designated for wood production or located in protected areas ([32_forestry],
*' [35_natveg]) (@kreidenweis_pasture_2018).
*'
*' Due to computational constraints, all model inputs in 0.5 degree resolution are aggregated
*' to simulation units for the optimization process ([80_optimization]) based on a clustering
*' algorithm (@dietrich_reducing_2013).
*'
*' MAgPIE estimates flows of different land-based greenhouse gases (GHGs). CO2 emissions are computed
*' from land-use change dynamics, i.e. from conversion of different biomes into agricultural land
*' and consequent loss of terrestrial carbon stocks (@popp_land-use_2014), also including the
*' depletion of organic matter in soils ([59_som]). The land also serves as a sink for atmospheric
*' carbon when agricultural land is set aside from production and the associated regrowth of natural
*' vegetation generates negative emissions from land-use change.
*' Nitrogen emissions ([51_nitrogen]) are estimated based on nitrogen budgets for croplands,
*' pastures ([50_nr_budgets]) and the livestock sector ([55_awms]) (@bodirsky_reactive_2014).
*' CH4 emissions are based on
*' livestock feed and rice cultivation areas (@popp_food_2010). In the case of mitigation
*' policies for the land sector, the model can reduce CO2 emissions by restraining land-use
*' conversion and consequent carbon release as well as CH4 and N emissions by applying improved
*' agricultural management (such as anaerobic digesters for CH4 capture from animal waste, or use
*' of fertilizer spreaders) (@popp_land-use_2014, @stevanovic_mitigation_2017). In addition,
*' the model covers land-based carbon removal technologies such as bioenergy with carbon capture
*' and sequestration (CCS) and afforestation (@humpenoder_investigating_2014,
*' @humpenoder_large-scale_2017, @kreidenweis_afforestation_2016).
*'
*' In response to all involved demand for agricultural commodities, costs of production,
*' biophysical constraints and land-related policies, MAgPIE simulates major dynamics of
*' the land-use sector like investments in research and development (R&D) ([13_tc]) (@dietrich_forecasting_2014)
*' and associated increases in both crop yields  ([14_yields]) and biomass removal through grazing on
*' pastures ([31_past]), land use change ([39_landconversion]), interregional trade flows ([21_trade]),
*' and irrigation ([41_area_equipped_for_irrigation]).
